\begin{abstract}
    The early detection of skin lesions is crucial for the treatment of severe diseases, such as skin cancer. However, these lesions are usually only diagnosed by dermatologists. Given that these professionals are not always available in regions with less healthcare infrastructure, it would be useful to have a tool capable of skin lesion classification and medical report generation. For this purpose, we fine-tuned \gls{llama} 3.2 11B with \gls{qlora} and \gls{lora}. The fine-tuning was performed in two scenarios, in the first scenario, we trained the model with the \gls{ham10000} dataset for classification tasks only, achieving an accuracy of up to 86.2\% with \gls{lora}. In the second scenario, the model was trained with the \gls{sttsc} dataset for both classification and report generation. The final models presented a classification accuracy of 45.2\% with \gls{qlora} and 44.5\% with \gls{lora}. This low performance can be explained by inconsistencies in the \gls{sttsc} dataset.

\section{Introduction}

Several skin diseases can have symptons such as skin lesions, most notably, skin cancer. An accurate and early classification of the lesion category is fundamental for an adequate treatment, However, this is a complex task that depends on many visual aspects \cite{habif2015clinical, skin_cancer_survival}. Furthermore, in Brazil, 30\% of malignant tumors are attributed to skin cancer, highlighting its relevancy \cite{skin_cancer_in_brazil}.

The early detection of skin cancer has a socio-economic factor. As noted in studies by \citet{skin_cancer_socioeconomic} and \citet{santos2020desigualdades}

The early detection of skin lesions has a socio-economic factor, as noted by \citet{skin_cancer_socioeconomic}, less educated patients have a worse prognostic, since they present tumors in more advanced stages.
