    abstract = {Abstract Survival from melanoma is inversely related to tumour
                thickness and is less favorable for those in lower socioeconomic
                (SES) strata. Reasons for this are unclear but may relate to a
                lower prevalence of skin screening. Our aim was to examine the
                association between melanoma thickness, individual-level SES and
                clinical skin examination (CSE) using a population-based
                case-control study. Cases were Queensland (Australia) residents
                aged 20–75 years with a histologically confirmed first primary
                invasive cutaneous melanoma diagnosed between January 2000 and
                December 2003. Telephone interviews were completed by 3,762 cases
                (77.7\%) and 3,824 (50.4\%) controls. Thickness was dichotomized
                to thin (≤2 mm) and thick (>2 mm). Compared with controls, the
                risk of thick melanoma was significantly increased among men
                [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.56, 95\% CI = 1.22–2.00], older
                participants (RRR = 1.76, 95\% CI = 1.10–2.82), those educated to
                primary level (RRR = 1.70, 95\% CI = 1.08–2.66), not
                married/living as married (RRR = 1.47, 95\% CI = 1.15–1.88),
                retired (RRR = 1.39, 95\% CI = 1.01–1.94) and not having a CSE in
                past 3 years (RRR = 1.45, 95\% CI = 1.12–1.86). There was a
                significant trend to increasing prevalence of CSE with higher
                education (p < 0.01) and the benefit of CSE in reducing the risk
                of thick melanoma was most pronounced among that subgroup. There
                were no significant associations between cases with thin melanoma
                and controls. Melanoma thickness at presentation is significantly
                associated with educational level, other measures of SES and
                absence of CSE. Public health education efforts should focus on
                identifying new avenues that specifically target those subgroups
                of the population who are at increased risk of being diagnosed
                with thick melanoma.},
